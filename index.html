<h4>Early life</h4>
Mahesh was born on 9 August 1975 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India.[8] He is the fourth of the five children of Telugu actor Krishna and Indira, after Ghattamaneni Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi and Manjula Swaroop and before Priyadarshini. Mahesh's childhood was spent mostly in Madras under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of his family.[9] Since Krishna was busy with his film commitments, Ramesh used to look after Mahesh's academic performance.[8] Along with his siblings, Mahesh used to play cricket regularly at the VGP Golden beach in Madras. To spend time with him, Krishna used to make sure that his films' shoots would be conducted at the VGP Universal Kingdom during the weekends.[8]<br>

Krishna also made sure that none of his children would reveal his name during their schooling to ensure a peaceful environment.[8] He was educated at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai where actor Karthi was his schoolmate.[10][11] Mahesh in an interview said that actor Vijay and he have been longtime close friends and studied at the same college before establishing themselves in their respective film industries.[12] Mahesh was an above average student. He obtained a bachelor's degree in commerce from the Loyola College, Chennai.[13] After graduating, he met with director L. Satyanand in Vishakhapatnam for further training in acting which went on for three to four months.[13] Being unable to read and write Telugu, he used to memorise the dialogues given by his directors during the dubbing phase of his films.
 
<h4>Media</h4>
Mahesh Babu is considered one of the most popular actors in Telugu cinema.[99] His popularity has been documented in several Telugu films such as Ashta Chamma (2008),[100] Kiraak (2014),[101] and Superstar Kidnap (2015).[102] He joined Twitter in April 2010 and has 9.5 million followers as of May 2020.</P>
