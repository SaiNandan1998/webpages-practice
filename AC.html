     <h3>Mahesh babu Acting Career</h3> 
   
      <p>At the age of four, Mahesh visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director
	  Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. 
	  Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[15] During the shoot of Poratam (1983) at Vauhini Studios, after watching Mahesh on 
	  the sets director Kodi Ramakrishna suggested to Krishna that he cast Mahesh in the role of the protagonist's brother. Initially terrified,
	  Mahesh agreed to act in the film after being persuaded by the film's crew.[15] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Shankharavam (1987), 
	  Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989).
	  Mahesh then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990). Later, Mahesh continued his college studies.[16]</p><br>
<br>
<h4>Early career and breakthrough (1999–2003)</h4>

<p>In 1999, Mahesh made his debut as a lead actor with the film Raja Kumarudu, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and co-starring Priety Zinta. The film was commercially successful, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[17] He received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[18] He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi. Following their poor performance at the box office, Mahesh starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari the next year. Mahesh called Murari an important 
film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites.[19][20] Murari was a commercial success and earned him the Nandi Special Jury Award.[18] Though his 2002 releases Takkari Donga and 
Bobby performed poorly at the box office, Mahesh received his second Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in the former.[18]</P><br>
<br>

<p>Mahesh had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla,
 which went on to become the highest 
grossing Telugu film of the year collecting ₹23 Crores at the boxoffice.
[21] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.
[22] The other release was Teja's Nijam co-starring Rakshita. 
The film was noted for introducing Dolby EX surround system in Telugu cinema.
[23] Though the film was a commercial failure,
[24] Mahesh received praise from the critics for his performance in the film, 
with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed a routine tale of vendetta.
[25] Mahesh won his first Nandi Best Actor Award for his performance in the film</p><br>
<br>
<p>Manjula produced his next film, Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. 
While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast was commercially successful, 
Naani flopped at the box office.[19] He received the Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[27] The failure of Naani depressed both Mahesh and Manjula,
 who took a small break in Goa before resuming their other commitments.[28]
 He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu, co-starring Trisha Krishnan, 
 whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.
 [29] Athadu became one of the highest-grossing films of the year.
 [30] The film was commercially profitable venture for the producers and distributors.
 [31] The film benefited Mahesh's career as he won the Nandi Best Actor Award for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.
 [32] Athadu collected a share of ₹25 Crores at the boxoffic<br>
