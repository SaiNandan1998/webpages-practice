     <h3>Mahesh babu Personal Life</h3> 
   <article>
      <p>During the shoot of B. Gopal's Vamsi at Australia, Mahesh began to date his co-star Namrata Shirodkar. After being in a relationship for four years, they decided to get married, and Manjula convinced Krishna in favour of their decision.[13] They were married on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu.[152] The couple welcomed their first child, a boy, on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[153] The boy, named Gautham Krishna, was a premature baby and was in critical condition during his birth. His condition turned stable after the doctors treated him in time.[76] On 20 July 2012 Namrata gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[154] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[155]

<h4>Controversy</h4>

<p>
In September 2004, Mahesh attended a rally organised by his fans at Warangal for the promotional activities of Arjun. He and his fans allegedly raided two video libraries and assaulted their owners who were circulating unauthorised CDs of the film. Cases under IPC section 448 (criminal trespass), section 427 (mischief) and section 366 (kidnap) were registered on Mahesh, who was the principal accused, and five others.[165] Later, a delegation from the Telugu film industry, including Chiranjeevi, Akkineni Nagarjuna, Ghattamaneni Krishna, Allu Aravind and Daggubati Suresh Babu, approached the then chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to intervene in this case. Regarding the issue, Mahesh said that while cases were booked against him, not a single case has been booked against the person dealing in bootlegged CDs, which he found the "funniest" thing.[166] Actor and filmmaker Pawan Kalyan openly supported Mahesh throughout the episode.[167] Mahesh surrendered in the district court on 20 September 2004 and appeared before the court again on 22 April 2006. The final hearing was held on 7 July 2006, and Mahesh and the others were exonerated.<br>

<h4>Philanthropy</h4>
Mahesh gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[159] Mahesh joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[160] He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment.[161] In October 2014, he donated ₹2.5 million to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of area destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud. Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala later donated ₹2.5 million to the fund.<br>

Jayadev announced in February 2015 that Mahesh would adopt Krishna's native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and would address basic needs of the community such as potable drinking water and better roads and drainage systems.[163] Mahesh also announced that he is working with Telangana's Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao to adopt another village in Mahbubnagar district.
